	<h1>Store Policy</h1>

	<h2>General Policy</h2>
	<h3>Products sold by Earthminers</h3>
	<p>Earthminers offers a 7 day return policy for products we sell directly. If something goes wrong with an eligible product and you notify us within 7 days of receiving the item, we will help you to reach a satisfactory resolution such as a return for replacement, exchange, or refund.</p>
	<p>After 7 days, our return policy expires and refunds/returns/exchanges are no longer covered. However, if you are dissatisfied with an item for any reason and the return policy has expired, you can still contact us at help@Earthminers.com and we will try to help if we can.
	If the product has a manufacturer’s warranty that is still active after the return time frame has elapsed, the buyer should contact the manufacturer directly.</p>
	<p>However, if the service center is not in your location, you may choose to contact Earthminers. 
	Please note that you will be responsible for the shipping cost and cost of repair (where the defect is not covered by the manufacturer's warranty).</p>
	<h3>Products sold by Third-Party Stores</h3>
	<p>Not all products on Earthminers are sold by Earthminers. Thousands of (‘third-party’) sellers from across Nigeria use the Earthminers marketplace to sell, and this means more products, more choice, and better pricing for you.</p>
	<p>Third-party sellers choose whether or not they offer a return policy, and if they offer one, they choose how long it lasts before it expires. Therefore, the return policy for Third-party items can vary: some Third-party sellers choose 3, 7 or even 14 day return policies, while other sellers choose to offer no return policy.</p>
	<p>If something goes wrong with an eligible product sold by a Third-party store and you notify us before the return policy set by the seller expires, we will help you to reach a satisfactory resolution such as a return for replacement, exchange, or refund. </p>

	<p>Within 48 hours, your request will be reviewed by us (and the seller, if applicable).</p>
	<h3>Complaint Feedback: </h3>
	<p>After your complaint is reviewed, your item may or may not be authorized for return (by Earthminers or a seller, as appropriate) depending on the ‘General Return Policy Eligibility’ factors described above.<br>
	If return is not authorized, this will be communicated along with the relevant reasons. If return is authorized, you will be sent an authorization along with appropriate information on where to drop off the item.</p>

	<p>If return is authorized, you will be asked to return the item within the timeframe communicated while ensuring that:</p>
	<p><ul>
	<li>The item is returned in its original packaging with all accessories intact</li>
	<li>The invoice is included with the reason for return written on it</li>
	<h3>Return Confirmation: </h3>
	<p>Once your return is received you will receive a confirmation, however if the item does not meet the criteria required for Return of Item, your return may be declined. Please note that this confirmation is simply a confirmation of the return and not of any defect, etc. as the item has not been inspected thoroughly.</p>
