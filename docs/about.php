	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>Our story goes back to 2019. Our founders knew each other via a platform they both used for buying and selling altcoins. They were fascinated by their interest in the technology deployed by the platform and wanted to build their own which gave birth to the Earthminers' platform.</p>

	<p>Earthminers is a network of people who have come together to build a one-stop platform for the minting and harvesting of crypto and digital products. The platform built is The Earthmine, which is a multi-functional platform which allows each participant to mint, keep and transfer money in a multi-currency online wallet; buy and sell currency on the exchange; invest money; get a loan in a convenient currency.</p>

	<p>There are investors and borrowers who also converge on the Earthminers platform. They meet each other and have the opportunity to lend money and transact on a mutually beneficial basis, making Earthminersa unique service that allows individuals to access loans from the comfort of their home in fiat and crypto-currencies.</p>
